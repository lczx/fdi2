## Abstract Factory
An Ã¼ber-factory that creates other factories; it is also called factory of factories.

With the Abstract Factory pattern, an interface is responsible for creating a factory of related objects, without explicitly specifying their classes.
Each generated factory creates objects as per the Factory pattern.
