## Decorator
The Decorator design pattern allows to add new functionalities to an existing object without altering its structure.

This patter creates a decorator class which wraps the original class and provides additional functionality
thus keeping existing method signatures intact.

In this example, we are going to add color functions to a `Shape` class by using the Decorator design pattern,
without altering the original `Shape`.
