## Adapter
The Adapter pattern works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.
It involves a single class which is responsible to join functionalities of two
indipendent or incompatible interfaces.

A real life example could be the case of a card reader which acts as an
adapter between a memory card and a laptop.
You plug in the memory card into the card reader and the card reader into the
laptop, so that the memory card can be read by the computer.

In this example, an audio player can play OGG files and uses another player to also play FLAC.
