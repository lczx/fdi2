## MVC
It stands for Model-View-Control and it is used to separate an application's concerns.

- **Model**: Represents an object or POJO carrying data. It can also have logic to update the controller if the data changes.
- **View**:  The visualization of the data that the model contains.
- **Controller**: Acts on both model and view; controls the data flow into the model and updates the view whenever the data changes, keeping the two concepts detached from each other.
